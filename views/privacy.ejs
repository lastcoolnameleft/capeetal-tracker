                <p><strong>In Short:</strong><strong> </strong>We collect personal information that you provide to us.
                </p>
                <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in
                    obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on
                    the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>
                <p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive information.</p>
                <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must

                    include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics,
                    operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
                    about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is
                    primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal

                <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which
                        can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
                        settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other
                        technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP
                        address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access
                        to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose
                        to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>

                <p><strong>In Short: </strong>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary
                    and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. , legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your
                    consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual
                    obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
                <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
                <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases

                    legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Consent. </strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e.
                        , consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your
                        consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is
                        reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not
                        outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your
                        personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is
                        necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement
                        body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as
                        evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is
                        necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as
                        situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>

                <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your

                <ul>
                    <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a

                <ul>

                </ul>
                <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of

                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability
                        or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to

                    outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out
                    in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
                    tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                    delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
                    personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
                    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do
                    we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at
                    least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
                    dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years
                    of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
                    delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from
                    children under age 18, please contact us at <a href='/contact'>contact page</a> .</p>

                    the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada , you have rights
                    that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change,

                </p>

                    by using the contact details provided in the section " <a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US

                <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
                    information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have
                    the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by

                        CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a> " below .</p>
                <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal
                    nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information
                    conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
                <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by
                    default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject
                    cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or
                    services of our Services.</p>

                <p><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (
                    "DNT" ) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology
                    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized . As such, we do not
                    currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                    choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
                <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there
                    currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
                    respond to them at this time.</p>

                    Utah, or Virginia , you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the
                    personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a
                    copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent
                    to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by
                    applicable law. More information is provided below.</p>
