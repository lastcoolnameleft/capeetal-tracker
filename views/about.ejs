				<h2 class="major">What the #%!$ is this?</h2>
				<p>Inspired by a road-trip for a wedding in Maine, I had to go really bad. As we were passing by
					Augusta, I asked "Can we stop here? I've never peed in this capital before."</p>
				<p>A few amusing conversations later, we started tracking how many US capitals we've urinated at and the
					idea for a website began!</p>
				<hr />
				<h2 class="major">What counts?</h1>
					<p>Any time you pee in the city limits of a US state capital, it counts! Whether it's in a public
						restroom, a bush, or a bottle in the car, it counts!</p>
				<hr />
				<h2 class="major">Don't you mean "capitol tracker"?</h1>
				<p>Nope! I'm talking about the city, not the building. <a
					href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/writing/capitol-vs-capital'>See
					this great article for reference.</a></p>

				<h2 class="major">I need to contact you about something!</h1>
